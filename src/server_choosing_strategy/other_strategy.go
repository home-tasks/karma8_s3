package choosingstrategy

// Here, some other strategy could have been implemented.
// For example, the one that stores files to the servers with more free space
// by either maintaining the current stored files or getting that info from the servers.
// Or a dummy one that just stores files in a circle (1, 2, 3, ..., n, 1, 2, 3, ...)
